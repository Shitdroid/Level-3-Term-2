This repository contains all the codes and resources for the course CSE 314 - Operating System Sessional.\
In this we have had two offlines up until now -

## 1. [Shell Scripting](https://github.com/Shitdroid/Level-3-Term-2/tree/master/CSE%20314/1.%20Shell)

-   Implement a script that will take some files submitted by students, organize and optionally execute the files and finally generate a report.
-   The resources given for this offline can be found [here](https://github.com/Shitdroid/Level-3-Term-2/tree/master/CSE%20314/1.%20Shell/Resources)

## 2. [xv6 system calls](https://github.com/Shitdroid/Level-3-Term-2/tree/master/CSE%20314/2.%20%20xv-6%20system%20calls)

-   Implement two system calls in xv6
    1. **Trace** - This will take the system call number and an command as input where the command is to be executed and the system call with the number is to be traced for that command.
    2. **History** - This will take the system call number as an input and print the number of time that system call has been called and the total time spent in that system call. If no input is give history is shown for all system calls.
-   [OPTIONAL] Implement a command that will shut down the system.
-   Generate a patch file for the changes made in the xv6 source code.
